It took a lot of effort to understand and solve all the issues related to building an e-commerce web app from scratch. I used Wordpress as a headless CMS and built an individual front-end by myself, including design and coding. This project helped me with understanding some main principles of communication between Wordpress/Woocommerce GraphQL API and the UI layer."
