            My name is Przemek and I am a 29 years old living in Pozna≈Ñ. There
            was a time I studied and graduated from Mechanical Engineering
            course. Long time ago, but still... Always loved cars and, as years
            spent at campus went by, I realized that the most interesting
            subsystem for me was engine. I mean combustion engine. Later, as a
            drivetrain engineer in PUT Motorsport Formula Student Team, there
            was a time I had believed I could become an F1 engineer. But the
            things tourned out differently...
          </p>
          <p>
            I love driving, getting to know cars, but I soon understood that
            there is to much hurry and carelessness in this field for me to
            handle. I like to do things in a way it was meant to be, not to save
            money once and lose twice.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other day I decided to give a try to programming and that's how
            it continued until today... And I don't intend to ever let the cars
            leave in my number one hobby zone.
